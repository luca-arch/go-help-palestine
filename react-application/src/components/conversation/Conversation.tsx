      Here is the conversation I had with a long-term friend of mine. Itâ€™s
      almost in its full version, but since she and I are both VERY stubborn ðŸ˜…,
      it is presented here only slightly redacted.
    </p>

      <strong>Me:</strong> Hey Stef, I recently asked a question to a new friend
      of mine and she said she is very upset about whatâ€™s going on in Palestine;
      she talks a lot about it and she posts stuff on her Instagram stories. But
      she got upset too when I told her that, in my opinion, itâ€™s rather
      pointless to talk about a problem unless youâ€™re also pointing out a
      possible solution. Iâ€™m an engineer, after all!
    </Blockquote>

    <p>
      <em>I asked her because she too posts a lot on this matter.</em>
    </p>

    <Blockquote>
      <strong>Stef:</strong> Why are you surprised? Are you happy with whatâ€™s
      going on there or do you just not care at all?
    </Blockquote>

    <Blockquote>
      <strong>Me:</strong> Iâ€™ve never said I was happy, itâ€™s just that I canâ€™t
      see what a single person like me could possibly do other than share videos
      via social media. Whatâ€™s the point in all of that? My friend said itâ€™s ok
      because, even if only one conscience gets awoken, it is still better than
      nothing. But I still feel like I canâ€™t do any good...
    </Blockquote>

    <Blockquote className="highlight">
      <strong>Stef:</strong> And your friend was right, sharing and posting is a
      lot of things! Like, if you change one opinion, and that opinion changes
      someone elseâ€™s and stuff... like, a lot of people are unaware of this
      situation, which is surprising but... For example, you and I are having
      this conversation right now, so itâ€™s about starting conversations and
      stuff like that, which is why I post!
      <br />
      Another point is about just keeping the headlines about Palestine, because
      if it changes to something else, like it already has - itâ€™s almost been a
      year of{" "}
      <strong title="Technically, the conflic has been going on for over 75 years, this is like the 14th war on Gaza">
        genocide
      </strong>{" "}
      - and to keep the funds coming into the country and all of these things...
      You NEED to keep talking about it!
      <br />
      So itâ€™s not necessarely about what her, herself do, but what we do as a
      collective.

    <p>
      <em>Then, she went on:</em>
    </p>

    <Blockquote className="highlight">
      <strong>Stef:</strong> If people had never posted about it, would it have
      been brought up to the International Court of Justice? Or would there have
      been protests all over the place? I think yeah, even if one person doesnâ€™t
      really have that much of an effect, if everyone has this mentality then
      itâ€™s really not gonna do anything!
      <br />
      Do I tell everyone theyâ€™re a terrible person if they donâ€™t post? No, but I
      think that it is good if you do post... It doesnâ€™t have to be like every
      day but whatever, itâ€™s just like, for me, I just try to post because I
      think that it is probably good to keep sharing the message, keeping people
      aware that this is an ongoing situation...
      <br />I know there is a ton of s**t going on in the world right now, but I
      think having a debate over it is never useless...

      <strong>Stef:</strong> And in terms of what does she/I do? Not that much,
      but weâ€™re still trying and I think thatâ€™s important, and surely there are
      better ways to help and everything, but I think itâ€™s not a competition:
      some people want to work directly on the field, others work in policy,
      others work in other jobs and then just do what they can outside of their
      job.
      <br />I think as long as youâ€™re aware of your privilege,{" "}
      <strong>stay educated</strong>
      and doing what you can, itâ€™s already better than a lot of people.
      <br />
      Itâ€™s normal to feel helpless as an individual, but itâ€™s about connecting
      and working together, not doing something alone that has a big impact
      because unless you want to lead your country or are a billionaire or
      something, itâ€™s likely not gonna happen.

      <strong>Me:</strong> Wow Stef, that was really insightful and helpful,
      thanks! I donâ€™t want to sound like a hypocrite, so I will try to get
      myself together first... but Iâ€™ll definitely follow your advice and do
      some homework - like, perhaps I could use my skills and do a little
      research to find charities online? I can start looking for them, making
      sure theyâ€™re genuine, legit, then share them on a website and donate?

      <strong>Stef:</strong> I have a link on my page that someone put together
      with a list of GoFundMes from families ðŸ™‚
      <br />
      But I think educating yourself and having conversations is most important
      if you donâ€™t have the money, especially with people who disagree with you!

        It was at this point that I realised I had the potential to bring a very
        tiny contribution. After all, long ago I used to make websites for a
        living.

    <p>
      And, letâ€™s be honest, nowadays you donâ€™t even need any specific skills to
      build a website, there are tons of tools out there that people can use for
      free.

      Although this one will cost around 20 USD per year, but hey, itâ€™s on me ðŸ˜‰
